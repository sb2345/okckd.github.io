### 4 Principles 

[link](http://codebetter.com/raymondlewallen/2005/07/19/4-major-principles-of-object-oriented-programming/)

1. Encapsulation

1. Abstraction

1. Inheritance

1. Polymorphism 

### Encapsulation

__The hiding of data implementation__ by restricting access to accessors and mutators. 

### Abstraction

__Representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden__.

For examplem, the development of classes, objects, types in terms of their interfaces and functionality, instead of their implementation details. 

Abstraction is used to manage complexity (decompose complex systems into smaller components).

### Inheritance

__The ability to derive new classes from existing classes__. 

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface. 

Eg. shape object.
