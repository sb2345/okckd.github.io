### Exceptions in Java

In Java, there are [3 categories of exceptions](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_exceptions.htm): 

1. checked exceptions
    1. Typically a user error
    1. eg. if a file cannot be found. 
    1. These exceptions cannot simply be ignored at the time of compilation.
    
1. runtime exceptions (also called un-checked exceptions)
    1. exception that could have been avoided by the programmer
    1. eg. NullPointerException
    1. ignored at the time of compilation

1. error
    1. These are not exceptions at all
    1. eg. stack overflow occurs
    1. also ignored at the time of compilation

#### 1. checked exception

[A checked exception](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2190175) __must be handled explicitly__ by the code (by either putting a try/catch block around the code, or adding a "throws" clause to the method).

The [class Exception](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html) and any subclasses that are not also subclasses of RuntimeException are __checked exceptions__. Example: 

1. FileNotFoundException
1. HttpRetryException
1. SocketException
1. IOException

Note: __java.lang.RuntimeException__ is a subclass of __java.lang.Exception__. 

#### 2. un-checked exceptions (RuntimeException)

A un-checked exception __does not need__ to be explicitly handled. 

[RuntimeException](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/RuntimeException.html) and its subclasses are __unchecked exceptions__. 

[Generally](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2190177) RuntimeExceptions __can be prevented__ programmatically. E.g NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException. If you check for null before calling any method, NullPointerException would never occur. Similarly ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException would never occur if you check the index first. RuntimeException are not checked by the compiler, so it is clean code.

The runtime exception classes __[are exempted](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2190659) from compile-time checking__, since the compiler cannot establish that run-time exceptions cannot occur.
