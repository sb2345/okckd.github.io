# Objects

Much of the power and flexibility of modern software analysis and design derives from its use of objects.

# Classes

Classes create an abstract representation of the world, letting you discard unnecessary details.

# The 3 properties

## Class

1. properties

1. __behavior__

1. relationships to other objects

## Object

1. state

1. __behavior__

1. identity
