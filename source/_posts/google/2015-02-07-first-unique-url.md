### Question 

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=11856466)

> Given a very long list of URLs, find the first URL which is unique ( occurred exactly once ). 

> Must do it in one traversal.

### Solution 

Suggested by the [top answer and second answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=11856466), using __a combination of trie and linked list__. 

1. The leaf node of a trie maintains a flag to record duplicate urls and pointer to a node in a link list. 

1. Use a doubly linked list to link all the unique ones
1. Remove the URL from the list if its count goes over 1
1. So after one traversal, the first one of your linked list is the desired one. 

Alternatively, we can also use __Hash__ instead of Trie.
