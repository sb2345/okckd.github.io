### Question 

[link](http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Code-a-hashmap-which-you-would-be-happy-to-place-into-a-production-environment-QTN_725885.htm)

> Code a hashmap which you would be happy to place into a production environment.

### Solution

We already write 2 post before:

1. __[Question] Implement a HashMap__

1. __[CC150v5] 8.10 Implement a Hashmap__

But still, this is not an easy question when asked at an interview. It won't harm to do a little recap: 

1. The basic structure is an array. It can be: 
    1. An array of linked nodes (with a next pointer). 
    1. An array of linked list. 
1. There should be a hash function. 
1. There should be a function to convert the hash value to corresponding array index. 
1. Remember there's __a concept of Load factor__. It means to what percentage the hashmap is filled. 
1. h & (length â€“ 1) means h % length, which maps a hashcode to an array index.
