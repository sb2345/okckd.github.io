### Question 

[link](http://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Code-a-hashmap-which-you-would-be-happy-to-place-into-a-production-environment-QTN_725885.htm)

> Code a hashmap which you would be happy to place into a production environment.

### Solution

We already write 2 post before:

1. __[Question] Implement a HashMap__

1. __[CC150v5] 8.10 Implement a Hashmap__

But still, this is not an easy question when asked at the interview site.
