[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5173972006076416)

### Solution

Basically, the formula is as follows:

> number = (previous_number * constant + other_constant) mod third_constant

The three constants are carefully selected, and a typical choice is:

> number = (previous_number * 214013 + 2531011) mod 2^15
