### Solution

This looks like a very difficult question, especially during a phone interview. 

__The 10th floor post the best solution__:

> __BFS from every box__. in each box, a non-blocking cell (include box position, but exclude hazard position) will have a weight value, stand for the distance to the box. 

> after bfs from all the boxes, each cell will have k weight, k is the number of boxes. sum all the weight in each cell, and find the cell with smallest sum of weight. 

> One problem of this solution may lead to a cell of a box. revision is sort the cell by sum of weight and find the first that is not a box. 

> complexity k*n^2
