### Question 

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5138832865361920)

> Draw a graph as a graph. Assume there is graphics library to draw lines and all. Just tell how will you order the vertices such that the edges don't intersect and they seem ordered. 

### Solution

There's no clear solution. Someone suggest the following: 

1. printing topological sort result (refer to post 'Topology Sort')
2. edges should not intersect, finding if a graph is planar

There's various [Planarity Testing Algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarity_testing).
