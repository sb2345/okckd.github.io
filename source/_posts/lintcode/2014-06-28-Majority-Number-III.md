### Question 

[link](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/majority-number-iii/)

> Given an array of integers and a number k, the majority number is the number that occurs more than 1/k of the size of the array. Find it.

> Note: There is only one majority number in the array

> Example: For [3,1,2,3,2,3,3,4,4,4] and k = 3, return 3

### Analysis 

Similar to 'Majority Number II', but a little more difficult. 

_Instead of keeping 2 value for checking, now keep k values__. Since values are constantly checked for existance, using a HashMap looks like a great idea. 

The idea is this. 

### Code

I did not write code for this question, because it looks too complex.
