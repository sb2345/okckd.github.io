### Question

> What is the difference between Final, Finally, and finalize? 

### final

__is a keyword__.

1. __Variable__ decleared as final should be initialized only once and cannot be changed. 
1. __Classes__ declared as final cannot be extended. 
1. __Methods__ declared as final cannot be overridden. 

Code:

	private final String name = "foo";
	
	public final String toString() {  return "NULL"; }
	
	// final can also make a class not "inheritable"
	public final class finalClass {...}
	public class classNotAllowed extends finalClass {...} 
	// Not allowed

### finally

__is a block__. 

The finally block __always executes__ when the try block exits (even if an unexpected exception occurs). 

	lock.lock();
	try {
	    //do stuff
	} catch (SomeException se) {
	    //handle se
	} finally {
	    lock.unlock(); //always executed, even if Exception or Error or se
	}

### finalize

__is a method__. 

__It's called by Garbage Collector__ before reclaiming GC eligible objects. 

	public void finalize() {
	    //free resources (e.g. unallocate memory)
	    super.finalize();
	}
