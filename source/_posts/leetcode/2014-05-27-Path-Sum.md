### Question 
[link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p></p><p>
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
</p>

For example:<br>
Given the below binary tree and <code>sum = 22</code>,
<pre>              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
</pre>

<p>
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path <code>5-&gt;4-&gt;11-&gt;2</code> which sum is 22.</p><p></p>
          </div>

### Analysis

__This question can be solved with either DFS or BFS__. 

### Solution

My code is __DFS recursion__. 

I found another BFS non-recursive solution [here](http://www.programcreek.com/2013/01/leetcode-path-sum/), but I did not post this code, because this question is too simple. 

__One more thing, the last line of code has a \|\| operation__. Isn't it duplicate execution? I mean if answer is found in root.left, no need to check root.right. 

Actually it's not duplication. The [official doc](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html) explains it: 

> The && and \|\| operators perform Conditional-AND and Conditional-OR operations on two boolean expressions. These operators exhibit "short-circuiting" behavior, which means that the second operand is evaluated only if needed.

### Code

    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        if (root == null) return false;
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) 
            return (sum == root.val);
        return hasPathSum(root.left, sum - root.val) 
            || hasPathSum(root.right, sum - root.val);
    }
