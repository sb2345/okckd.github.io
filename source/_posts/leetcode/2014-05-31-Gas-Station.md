### Question 
[link](https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/)

<div class="question-content">
            <p class="font-color"></p><p class="font-color">
There are <i>N</i> gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station <i>i</i> is <code>gas[i]</code>.
</p>

<p class="font-color">
You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs <code>cost[i]</code> of gas to travel from station <i>i</i> to its next station (<i>i</i>+1). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
</p>

<p class="font-color">
Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once, otherwise return -1.
</p>

<p class="font-color">
<b>Note:</b><br>
The solution is guaranteed to be unique.

### Analysis

__This is a tough question, which requires a lot of math-related thinking__. 

__My solution is IMHO very simple and easy__. I first do a cumulation of gas from beginning to the end, and find the lowest cumulative value of the  gas tank (of course can be negative). That point is where I start the journey, which is to say, I will validate the path from that point, and then return the result. 

__This idea is not seen on Internet__, although it is just 2 loops thru the list, and time complexity is also O(n). Anyway, there's a great solution which most people uses. 

__There's a great [post](https://oj.leetcode.com/discuss/4159/share-some-of-my-ideas) that gives 2 valid conclusions__: 

> 1. If car starts at A and can not reach B (let's say B is the first station that A can not reach), then any station between A and B can not reach B.
> 2. If the total number of gas is bigger than the total number of cost. There must be a valid solution. 

From here, a great solution can be found. 

### Solution

__A very detailed explanation and code is found from [this blog](http://leetcodenotes.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/leetcode-gas-station-%E8%BD%AC%E5%9C%88%E7%9A%84%E5%8A%A0%E6%B2%B9%E7%AB%99%E7%9C%8B%E8%83%BD%E4%B8%8D%E8%83%BD%E8%B5%B0%E4%B8%80%E5%9C%88/)__.

> 1. 从i开始，j是当前station的指针，sum += gas[j] – cost[j] （从j站加了油，再算上从i开始走到j剩的油，走到j+1站还能剩下多少油）
> 2. 如果sum < 0，说明从i开始是不行的。那能不能从i..j中间的某个位置开始呢？假设能从k (i <=k<=j)走，那么i..j < 0，若k..j >=0，说明i..k – 1更是<0，那从k处就早该断开了，根本轮不到j。
> 3. 所以一旦sum<0，i就赋成j + 1，sum归零。

And note that if i is moved to j, there is no need to check (0..old_i) again, because this range must be reachable (write code again for beter understanding). 

Coding this solution __is not easy__! I failed to do it. 

### Code

__First, my solution__

    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int len = gas.length;
		if (len == 0) return -1;
		int start = -1, min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, total = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < len; i ++) {
			total += getDiff(gas, cost, i);
			if (total < min) {
				min = total;
				start = i;
			}
		}
		start = (start + 1) % len;
		// now traverse the route from start 
		total = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < len; i ++) {
			total += getDiff(gas, cost, (start + i) % len);
			if (total < 0) return -1; 
		}
		return start;
    }
	
	private int getDiff(int[] gas, int[] cost, int i) {
		return gas[i] - cost[i];
	}

__Second, best solution__

    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int total = 0;
        while (j < gas.length) {
            int diff = gas[j] - cost[j];
            if (sum + diff < 0) {
                i = j + 1;
                sum = 0;
            } else {
                sum += diff;
            }
            j++;
            total += diff;
        }
        return total >= 0 ? i : -1;
    }
