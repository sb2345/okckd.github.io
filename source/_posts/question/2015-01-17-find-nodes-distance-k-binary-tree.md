### Question

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=15069740)

> Find the nodes at d distance from a certain node in a Binary Tree

### Solution

[There are two types](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/) of nodes to be considered: 

1. Nodes in the subtree rooted of the target node. 
1. Other nodes, may be an ancestor of target, or a node in some other subtree. 

The details of find these nodes: 

1. Find the nodes which can be reached in k hops from the given node.

2. Second part we look at those nodes __on the upper part of the tree__. The parent of the given node is 1 hop away. Hence in the __other child subtree__ of the parent, we find nodes with k-1 hops. 
    
    Similarly the grand parent of B, we find nodes with k - 2 distance. 

Implementation: 

1. Start from root, __store all nodes in a queue__ of maximum size k till you reach the given node. 

1. Call FindNodesAtDistance() on the nodes from the queue to get all the nodes __distance k -i__ from the node.
