### Question 

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-length-unsorted-subarray-sorting-which-makes-the-complete-array-sorted/)

> Given an unsorted array arr[0..n-1] of size n, find the minimum length subarray arr[s..e] such that sorting this subarray makes the whole array sorted.

### Solution

The solution from [gfg](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-length-unsorted-subarray-sorting-which-makes-the-complete-array-sorted/) is definitely good, but I find [this graphic explanation](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15855670) a really great resource. 

The idea is, find min and max in the unsorted proportion, and trim the original array. 

### Code

not written.
