### Question 

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/design-and-implement-special-stack-data-structure/)

> Implement a stack, enable O(1) Push, Pop Top, Min. Where Min() will return the value of minimum number in the stack. 

### Solution

Using two stacks. 

The first one is the regular stack. 

The second one only store minimum numbers. 

Eg: 

> Actual stack: (head) 16 15 29 19 18 (tail)
>
> Auxiliary Stack: (head) 15 15 18 18 18 (tail)

### Code

Psudu-code:

    Push(int x):
    1) push x to the first stack (the stack with actual elements)
    2) compare x with the top element of the second stack (the auxiliary stack). Let the top element be y.
    …..a) If x is smaller than y then push x to the auxiliary stack.
    …..b) If x is greater than y then push y to the auxiliary stack.

    Pop():
    1) pop the top element from the auxiliary stack.
    2) pop the top element from the actual stack and return it.

Code is skipped.
