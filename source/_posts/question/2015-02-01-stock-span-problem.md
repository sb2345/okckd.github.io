### Solution

Explanation from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/8765049): 

1. Build a binary tree. Each branch in the tree contains a sprite. 
1. Each __leaf node represents available space__. 
1. Initially the tree has just the root node, which represents all available space. 
1. To add a sprite to the tree, search the tree for an unoccupied (leaf) node __big enough__ to hold the sprite. 
1. Turn that node from a leaf into a branch by setting the sprite as the node's occupant and giving the node two children. 
1. One child represents the remaining space to the right of the sprite; 
1. the other represents the remaining space below the sprite and the first child.

For detailed implementation and code, refer to [this](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/) comprehensite guide. BTW, it's used for __auto generating CSS Sprites__ which puts images into a large graph.
