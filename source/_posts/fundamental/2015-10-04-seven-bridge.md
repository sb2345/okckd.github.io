# Overview

In East Prussia(普鲁士), people try to walk all [7 bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg) w/o crossing a bridge twice.

Leonhard Euler (pronounced "oiler") – Swiss

# Euler path

An Euler path, also called an Eulerian trail, is a walk on the graph edges of a graph which uses each graph edge in the original graph exactly once.

## Degree

Node degree of a vertex: the number of edges incident with it.

## Euler Theorem

A graph contains an euler path iffeither of the following cases hold:

1. All except for two nodes have even degrees – the 2 odd-degree nodes must be start and end points
1. all nodes have even degrees.

# Application

networks, distributed systems, coding theory
