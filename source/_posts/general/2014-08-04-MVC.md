### Overview

[Model–view–controller]((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing __user interfaces__. 

### Components 

The central component of MVC, __the model__, captures the application's behavior in terms of its problem domain, independent of the user interface. The model directly manages the application's data, logic and rules. 

__A view__ can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram; multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 

The third part, __the controller__, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

Early web MVC frameworks took a thin client approach that placed almost the entire MVC on server. As client technologies have matured, MVC components can be executed partly on the client(AJAX). 

### Other good explanation

MVC is a [user interface design pattern](http://geekswithblogs.net/gregorymalcolm/archive/2009/07/14/user-interface-patterns.aspx). 

1. Controller – Represents interactions, typically with the mouse or keyboard, or in the case of web applications, in the form of HTTP requests.
 
1. View – Renders the graphical output of the application
 
1. Model – Everything else. In particular this includes __the data and business logic__.
