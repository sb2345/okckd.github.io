### First word

It's been around 2 month since I started doing Leetcode OJ, and a little more than a month since my first blog. 

__As of May 31st, 2014 Saturday__, I have solved __147/151 questions__ on LeetCode, plus __135 blog posts__. 

Unsolved questions are: 

1. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
2. Word Ladder II
3. Word Break II
4. LRU Cache

And while doing this, I also have a 9-to-5 job to feed myself. 

### Thoughts

I think this is a fruitful two months for me, from where I have struggled, compromised, grown, went sleepless, went crazy, went on fire and went exhausted from time to time, until I finally realize that I am beginning to see a bit of silver lining. But the more that I learn, the better that I understand how much more I am still lacking. 

I always thought this is gonna be a journey that takes me from one point to another, but __No__. It's not that simple. In the end, this might just be an infinitely long and tortuous journey that eventually take me to nowhere. But on the other hand, I never have believed in my entire life, that there's something in this world that I can't do. Sometimes hard work pays off, and sometimes good luck does. I always have both. And that gives me no reason to shrink. 

### Silver Lining

I suddenly remembered a great movie "__Silver Lining Playbook__" featuring Pat and Tiffany's difficult journey to happiness. 

> Pat: This is what I learned at the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, you have a shot at a silver lining.

> Tiffany: Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works. I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

> Tiffany: Humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

> Tiffany: You know, for a while, I thought you were the best thing that ever happened to me. But now I'm starting to think you're the worst.

> Pat: The only way you can beat my crazy was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck.

I wish silvering lining will open up for me in the near future. 

And Happy Dragon Boat Festival, I just realize that.
