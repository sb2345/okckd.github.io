### Question

> Given a lengthy document without spaces, punctuation, and capitalization:

> eg: iresetthecomputeritstilldidntboot

> Now add back in the punctation and capitalization. 

> Most of the words will be in a dictionary, but some strings, like proper names, will not. Given a dictionary (a list of words), design an algorithm to find the optimal way of "unconcatenating" a sequence of words (by minimizing unrecognized sequences of characters).

> For example, the string "jesslookedjustliketimherbrother" would be optimally parsed as "JESS looked just like TIM her brother". This parsing has seven unrecognized characters, which we have capitalized for clarity. 

### Solution



### Code
