### Question

> Consider a simple node-like data structure called BiNode, which has pointers to two other nodes.

    public class BiNode {
        public BiNode nodel, node2;
        public int data;
    }

The data structure BiNode could be used to represent both a binary tree (where nodel is the left node and node2 is the right node) or a doubly linked list (where nodel is the previous node and node2 is the next node). Implement a method to convert a binary search tree (implemented with BiNode) into a doubly linked list. The values should be kept in order and the operation should be performed in place (that is, on the original data structure). 

### Solution



### Code
