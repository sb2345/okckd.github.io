### Question

> How to prevent deadlock? (question from MIT handouts 1)

### Analysis

Preventing one of the 4 conditions will prevent deadlock: 

1. Removing the __mutual exclusion condition__, but not very possible. 

1. The __hold and wait__ conditions may be removed by requiring processes to request all the resources they will need before starting up. 

1. The __no preemption condition__ may also be difficult or impossible to avoid as a process has to be able to have a resource for a certain amount of time, or the processing outcome may be inconsistent or thrashing may occur. 

1. The final condition is the __circular wait condition__. Approaches that avoid circular waits include disabling interrupts during critical sections and using a hierarchy to determine a partial ordering of resources. 

### Answer

__Assign an order to our locks__ (require that the locks always acquired in order). 

This prevent 2 thread waiting to get the resource in each other's hand.
