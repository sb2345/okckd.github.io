### Traditional RDBMS

Data is organized in a highly-structured manner, following the relational model. 

The need for the data to be well-structured actually becomes a substantial burden at extremely large volumes.

### NoSQL

A completely different framework of databases that allows for high-performance, agile processing of information at massive scale. 

NoSQL centers around the concept of distributed databases. 

It's horizontally scalable; as data continues to explode, just add more hardware to keep up.

### Hadoop

Hadoop is not a type of database, but rather a software ecosystem that allows for massively parallel computing.

Hadoop is [an open source implementation](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077907/open-source-tools/mapreduce-programming-with-apache-hadoop.html?page=3) of the MapReduce programming model. Hadoop relies not on Google File System (GFS), but on its own Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). 

### MapReduce

An example of the Hadoop ecosystem is MapReduce. 

It's a computational model that basically takes intensive data processes and spreads the computation across a potentially endless number of servers.
