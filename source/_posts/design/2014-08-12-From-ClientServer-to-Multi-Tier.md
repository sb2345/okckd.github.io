### Client/Server

[link](http://wiki.remobjects.com/wiki/From_Client/Server_to_Multi-Tier)

Client have __direct and full access to the physical database__ based on their login string. This is the major weakness of the Client/Server paradigm. The system is vulnerable to attacks. 

Because all business logic was __implemented on the client application__, changes to business logic means redeploying new client software to all users again. 

Another drawback is that the network interface provided by most back-end database systems has been designed for access over the local network, using fast connections and no firewalls. Nowadays, many clientsâ€™ software needs to run from employee's home offices or from airport lounges. In many cases such connections __will be unreliable or inefficient__ to work on. 

### Multi-Tier

The communication between clients and middle-tier server is __no longer tied to a protocol dictated by the database__ (no database drivers or connection string on the client). Client applications can authenticate with __a username and password (compare to login string)__. 

Communication can be done via HTTP or HTTPS, alternatively or additionally, open standards such as __SOAP, OData and JSON can be used to expose a middle tier__ to different clients using protocols that are widely understood. 

Biggest advantage is that __all the business logic is transferred from client application into the middle tier__. And the middle tier holds the final control over what data goes in or out. 

Still, there're still some business logic on the client tier as well. But it only __complement the rules__ that are enforced on the server. Eg. Twitter enforce the 140 character limit locally, and stop you from sending a tweet that is too long (by graying out the Send button). 

That means, client side checks are for convenience, and for convenience only; the middle tier server is and must be authoritative for what is allowed and what is not.
