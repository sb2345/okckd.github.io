### Shared hosting

[Shared hosting](https://kb.greengeeks.com/3072/shared-hosting-vs-vps-hosting/) is like living in an apartment where you share a common space with your neighbors. You cannot customize anything but you share maintenance cost and responsibility with your neighbors.

1. Economical 
1. Technical maintenance of the server is not required 
1. Limited number of resources 
1. Your website performance may be affected by other websites hosted on the shared server 
1. Possible long term problems with scalability and backup 
1. Possible security issues for sharing a common server 

### Virtual Private Server

Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting is like living in a simplex or half-plex where you can customize everything to your own tastes. However, you still need to maintain your own area. Companies that deal with resource-heavy applications and secured data most often use VPS. 

1. Larger space and bandwidth 
1. Can configure anything 
1. Run your own batch files to create multiple services inside the server using shell access 
1. Easy scalability and backup 
1. You need a dedicated system administrator 
1. Costly
