### 

A Hadoop cluster is __a special type of computational cluster__ designed specifically for storing and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in a distributed computing environment. 

Such clusters __run Hadoop's open source distributed processing software__ on low-cost commodity computers. 

Typically one machine in the cluster is designated as the __NameNode__ and another machine the as __JobTracker__; these are the masters. The rest of the machines in the cluster act as both __DataNode and TaskTracker__; these are the slaves.

Hadoop clusters are known for boosting the speed of data analysis applications. They also are highly scalable.

As of early 2013, Facebook was recognized as having the largest Hadoop cluster in the world.
