Hello guys! My name is __CodeMonkey__. {% img right /assets/images/7275831.png 300 %}

I'm Chinese. And yes, you already guessed so by the mix of language I use from my blog posts. 

I love gadgets. I do have a lot of gadgets. Of the only thing I can't live without is __iPad__!

I do Java for bread, and I kinda like it.

I write about IT, algorithm and interviews tricks.

I talk a lot, although deep down inside, I do prefer __coding__. (Long live all the developers~)

You may wonder what does '__Woodstock__' means? The name of this blog. 

Well, It's a small little bird from the Snoopy Comics. 

Woodstock is Snoopy's sidekick, a hilarious little bird. I love it. 

Feel free to leave a comment below! You can write about anything.
