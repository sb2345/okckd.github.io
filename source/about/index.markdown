Hello guys! My name is Michael. I'm from Singapore. 

I love Snoopy. Woodstock (the name of this blog) is Snoopy's pet. 

I love to watch NBA, my favorite player is Kevin Durant. 

I love Java and my girfriend >_< (yes, I'm a developer and I have a girlfriend)

I love tech gadgets, tech news and startups.

I write about IT, algorithm and interviews tricks. 

Feel free to leave a comment!
