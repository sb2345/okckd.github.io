Hi folks! I am CodeMonkey and I am a Java developer and an algorithm rookie. {% img right /assets/images/7275831.png 300 %}

Are you looking for a job? Are you starting to learn algorithms? 

Struggling or having fun? If you are experiencing both (just like me), please let me know by leaving me a comment! 

This blog took off in 2014 as my personal references site. Later, many people found the resources useful to them, so I decided to share it publicly. 

I sincerely wish this site help you!
