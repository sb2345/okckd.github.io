几米说过：“每个人都有一双翅膀；有的人长在脚上，有的人长在手上，有的人长在头上，有的人长在心上。__翅膀长在哪里，你的天赋就在哪里__。”

每个人都有自己难以启齿的一面。但是说真的，没有人会在乎你。人们不会对你的缺陷念念不忘，人们只会在你最春风得意的时候，突然想起来：“哦？那家伙不是少两根手指吗？这也能办到，好厉害……”

我的日记本上写着一句话，我想把它送给大家：__你失败一千次也不会有人记得你，因为人们只会记住你成功的一次__。

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[	Please tell me what is taking place,
	Cause I can't seem to find a trace,
	Guess it must've got erased somehow,
	Probably cause I always forget,
	Everytime someone tells me their name,
	It's always gotta be the same.
	(In my World)
	Never wore cover-up,
	Always beat the boys up,
	Grew up in a 5000 population town,
	Made my money by cutting grass,
	Got fired by fried chicken ass,
	All in a small town, Napanee.

	You know I always stay up without sleepin',
	And think to myself,
	Where do I belong forever,
	In whose arms, the time and place?

	[Chorus:]
	Can't help if I space in a daze,
	My eyes tune out the other way,
	I may switch off and go in a daydream,
	In this head my thoughts are deep,
	But sometimes I can't even speak,
	Would someone be and not pretend? 
	I'm off again in my World

	I never spend less than an hour,
	Washin' my hair in the shower,
	It always takes 5 hours to make it straight,
	So I'll braid it in a zillion braids,
	Though it may take all friggen day,
	There's nothin' else better to do anyway.

	When you're all alone in the lands of forever,
	Lay under the milky way,
	On and on it's getting too late out,
	I'm not in love this time this night.

	[Chorus:] x1

	Take some time,
	Mellow out,
	Party up,
	But don't fall down,
	Don't get caught,
	Sneak out of the house.

	[Chorus:] x2

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Life isn't always going along nicely. 

Remember this. 

Keep Holding On

	You're not alone, together we stand
	I'll be by your side you know I'll take your hand
	When it gets cold, and it feels like the end
	There's no place to go you know I won't give in
	(Ah, Ah) No I won't give in (Ah, Ah-Ah)

	Keep holding on
	'Cause you know we'll make it through
	We'll make it through

	Just stay strong
	'Cause you know I'm here for you
	I'm here for you

	There's nothing you can say (Nothing you can say)
	Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
	There's no other way when it comes to the truth so

	Keep holding on
	'Cause you know we'll make it through
	We'll make it through

	So far away, I wish you were here
	Before it's too late this could all disappear
	Before the doors close, and it comes to an end
	With you by my side I will fight and defend
	(Ah, Ah) I'll fight and defend (Ah, Ah-Ah) Yeah, Yeah

	Keep holding on (x1)

	Hear me when I say when I say "I believe"
	Nothing's gonna change nothing's gonna change destiny
	Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
	Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh-Ah-Ah (Ah-Ah, Ah-Ah)
	La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da

	Keep holding on(x2)

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/07/21/thoughts-on-leetcode-4/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/07/21/thoughts-on-leetcode-4</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Some stats

I started Leetcode __4 month ago__, and I took me around __2 month__ to finish most of the questions. I spent another __1 month__ to re-solve many questions, following the instructions from NineChap. Until 2 weeks ago, there're __in total 1861 submissions (or 18 submission per day)__.

From 2 weeks ago till today, I registed a new Leetcode account and solved __144/151 questions__ using __427 submission (or 35 submissions per day)__. I will probably finish up everything in 1 or 2 days' time. 

The AC/submission rate shall be used as a benchmark for future improvement. 

### Thoughts

Keep up the hard work! ]]></content>
