Remember this. 

Keep Holding On of Avril Lavigne. 

	You're not alone, together we stand
	I'll be by your side you know I'll take your hand
	When it gets cold, and it feels like the end
	There's no place to go you know I won't give in
	(Ah, Ah) No I won't give in (Ah, Ah-Ah)

	Keep holding on
	'Cause you know we'll make it through
	We'll make it through

	Just stay strong
	'Cause you know I'm here for you
	I'm here for you

	There's nothing you can say (Nothing you can say)
	Nothing you could do (Nothing you could do)
	There's no other way when it comes to the truth so

	Keep holding on
	'Cause you know we'll make it through
	We'll make it through

	So far away, I wish you were here
	Before it's too late this could all disappear
	Before the doors close, and it comes to an end
	With you by my side I will fight and defend
	(Ah, Ah) I'll fight and defend (Ah, Ah-Ah) Yeah, Yeah

	Keep holding on (x1)

	Hear me when I say when I say "I believe"
	Nothing's gonna change nothing's gonna change destiny
	Whatever's meant to be will work out perfectly
	Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh, Yea-Eh-Ah-Ah (Ah-Ah, Ah-Ah)
	La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da, La-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da-Da

	Keep holding on(x2)

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Some stats

I started Leetcode __4 month ago__, and I took me around __2 month__ to finish most of the questions. I spent another __1 month__ to re-solve many questions, following the instructions from NineChap. Until 2 weeks ago, there're __in total 1861 submissions (or 18 submission per day)__.

From 2 weeks ago till today, I registed a new Leetcode account and solved __144/151 questions__ using __427 submission (or 35 submissions per day)__. I will probably finish up everything in 1 or 2 days' time. 

The AC/submission rate shall be used as a benchmark for future improvement. 

### Thoughts

Keep up the hard work! ]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### First word

It's been around 2 month since I started doing Leetcode OJ, and a little more than a month since my first blog. 

__As of May 31st, 2014 Saturday__, I have solved __147/151 questions__ on LeetCode, plus __135 blog posts__. 

Unsolved questions are: 

1. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
2. Word Ladder II
3. Word Break II
4. LRU Cache

And while doing this, I also have a 9-to-5 job to feed myself. 

### Thoughts

I think this is a fruitful two months for me, from where I have struggled, compromised, grown, went sleepless, went crazy, went on fire and went exhausted from time to time, until I finally realize that I am beginning to see a bit of silver lining. But the more that I learn, the better that I understand how much more I am still lacking. 

I always thought this is gonna be a journey that takes me from one point to another, but __No__. It's not that simple. In the end, this might just be an infinitely long and tortuous journey that eventually take me to nowhere. But on the other hand, I never have believed in my entire life, that there's something in this world that I can't do. Sometimes hard work pays off, and sometimes good luck does. I always have both. And that gives me no reason to shrink. 

### Silver Lining

I suddenly remembered a great movie "__Silver Lining Playbook__" featuring Pat and Tiffany's difficult journey to happiness. 

> Pat: This is what I learned at the hospital. You have to do everything you can, you have to work your hardest, and if you do, you have a shot at a silver lining.

> Tiffany: Listen, I haven't dated since before my marriage so I don't really remember how this works. I saw the way you were looking at me, Pat. You felt it, I felt it, don't lie. We're not liars like they are. I live in the addition around back, which is completely separate from my parents' house, so there's no chance of them walking in on us. I hate the fact that you wore a football jersey to dinner because I hate football, but you can fuck me if you turn the lights off, okay?

> Tiffany: Humanity is just nasty and there's no silver lining.

> Tiffany: You know, for a while, I thought you were the best thing that ever happened to me. But now I'm starting to think you're the worst.

> Pat: The only way you can beat my crazy was by doing something crazy yourself. Thank you. I love you. I knew it the minute I met you. I'm sorry it took so long for me to catch up. I just got stuck.

I wish silvering lining will open up for me in the near future. 

And Happy Dragon Boat Festival, I just realize that.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### First word

__As of May 18th, 2014 Sunday__, I have solved __120/151 questions__ on LeetCode, plus __60+ blog posts__.

### Thoughts 

When I started doing LeetCode and try to come up with solutions, I was generally good in productivity. But recently as I start to read other people's code and try to find the best solution from the internet, I started to slow down my pace. I thought it's a good thing, because reading other people's code helps me to diverse my thinking. As a matter of fact, it really is good. However, as the number of difficult problems start to increase, I am starting to face some bottleneck with productivity. I am sometimes stuck in 1 problem for 2+ hours, and sometime I start to be bored at reading code. Maybe it's the lack of sleep, I would feel dizzy sometimes doing LeetCode. I am sure that my passion in keep doing this has never decreased, but maybe I was just trying to hard. 

__Keep in mind that learning is not always as exciting as the first few days__, and keep holding on.
