    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### The problem

In setting up the octopress environment, we need to install dependencies like this: 

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

First line simply installs bundler (a Ruby dependency manager). The second line is where you might face problems:

> bundle install
>
> [Install the dependencies](http://bundler.io/man/bundle-install.1.html) specified in your Gemfile

Look at the Gemfile in your octopress folder, it looks like [this](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/Gemfile): 

    source "https://rubygems.org"

    group :development do
      gem 'rake', '~> 10.0'
      gem 'jekyll', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'octopress-hooks', '~> 2.2'
      gem 'octopress-date-format', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
      gem 'rdiscount', '~> 2.0'
      gem 'RedCloth', '~> 4.2.9'
      gem 'haml', '~> 4.0'
      gem 'compass', '~> 1.0.1'
      gem 'sass-globbing', '~> 1.0.0'
      gem 'rubypants', '~> 0.2.0'
      gem 'rb-fsevent', '~> 0.9'
      gem 'stringex', '~> 1.4.0'
    end

    gem 'sinatra', '~> 1.4.2'

When I do 'bundle install': 

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/........
    Resolving dependencies...

    Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read
    server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/rake-
    10.4.2.gem)
    An error occurred while installing rake (10.4.2), and Bundler cannot continue.
    Make sure that `gem install rake -v '10.4.2'` succeeds before bundling.

It shows the gem 'rake' is missing. So I did as I was instrcucted to. I type __gem install rake -v '10.4.2'__ into command line, and execute. Again, I was told another gem missing. I kept doing this, until I found this is an endless procedure: 

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/.......
    Using rake 10.3.2
    Using RedCloth 4.2.9
    Using blankslate 2.1.2.4

    Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read
    server certificate B: certificate verify failed (https://rubygems.org/gems/timer
    s-1.1.0.gem)
    An error occurred while installing timers (1.1.0), and Bundler cannot continue.
    Make sure that `gem install timers -v '1.1.0'` succeeds before bundling.

Something is very wrong with the execution of 'bundle install'. 

### The solution

Until I found [this post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15529451/octopress-installation-stops-during-bundle-install), I was hopelessly searching and learning Ruby gems and related things. 

I fact, I just deleted 1 letter by changing __source "https://rubygems.org"__ to __source "http://rubygems.org"__ at line 1 of Gemfile in octopress folder. 

Then, everything is fine: 

    $ bundle install
    Fetching gem metadata from http://rubygems.org/........

    Post-install message from compass:
        Compass is charityware. If you love it, please donate on our behalf at http:
    //umdf.org/compass Thanks!
    Post-install message from haml:

    HEADS UP! Haml 4.0 has many improvements, but also has changes that may break
    your application:

    * Support for Ruby 1.8.6 dropped
    * Support for Rails 2 dropped
    * Sass filter now always outputs <style> tags
    * Data attributes are now hyphenated, not underscored
    * html2haml utility moved to the html2haml gem
    * Textile and Maruku filters moved to the haml-contrib gem

    For more info see:

    http://rubydoc.info/github/haml/haml/file/CHANGELOG.md

I guess this is because my network security settings, but I do not know. If you are facing the same issue, I hope my solution helped. Or if you know the reason, please tell me by leaving a comment below. Thanks!

    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/12/22/RubyGems-gem-other</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Sometme I found the different concepts in Ruby very confusing for beginners. So I write this post to explain some terminologies in ruby setup. 

### RubyGems (tool)

__[RubyGems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems)__ is a package manager for the Ruby programming language. 

It is a tool to manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. 

RubyGems is very similar to apt-get, portage, and yum in functionality.

### gem (command)

'gem' command allows you to interact with RubyGems. It is used build, upload, download, and install Gem packages. 

Installation:

    gem install mygem

Uninstallation:

    gem uninstall mygem

Listing installed gems:

    gem list --local

Listing available gems, e.g.:

    gem list --remote

### Gemfile (text file)

[A Gemfile](http://bundler.io/man/gemfile.5.html) describes the gem dependencies required to execute associated Ruby code.

It is placed in the root of the directory containing the associated code. 

A Gemfile is evaluated as Ruby code, in a context which makes available a number of methods used to describe the gem requirements.

### gem (program) 

[ref1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5233924/what-is-a-ruby-gem), [ref2](http://guides.rubygems.org/what-is-a-gem/)

A gem is a module/Library that you can install and use in every project on your server. 

Each gem has a __name, version, and platform__. For example, __rake gem__ has a 10.3.2 version on platform Ruby.

Inside a gems are the following components: 

1. Code (including tests and supporting utilities)
1. Documentation
1. gemspec

Standard code structure:

    % tree freewill
    freewill/
    ├── bin/
    │   └── freewill
    ├── lib/
    │   └── freewill.rb
    ├── test/
    │   └── test_freewill.rb
    ├── README
    ├── Rakefile
    └── freewill.gemspec

### Bundler (dependency manager)

[ref](http://bundler.io/)

Bundler manages an application's dependencies. 

Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/07/21/Clone-octopress-blog-from-a-different-computer/"/>
    <updated>2014-07-21T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/07/21/Clone-octopress-blog-from-a-different-computer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[__Ruby/gem/bundler setup (on a new machine) has always been a hassle to me__. Not only that, I've had some confusions about developing Octopress blog on 2 different computers. 

Now that I've had enough failures and success, I would like write a long post to summarize it. 

### Install Ruby

Well first of all, we must install __Ruby__ and __Development Kit__. Simply go this [this page](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and download: 

1. Ruby 1.9.3
1. DevKit for Ruby 1.9.3

__Installing Ruby__ is straight-forward, only remember to check "Add Ruby to your PATH". Otherwise you need to manually set the __Ruby directory__ (eg. C:\Ruby193\bin) in __System Variables Settings__. 

<img class="middle" src="/assets/images/install-ruby-193.png">

__Ruby DevKit is a self-extracting archive__. After extracting the files, we should [initialize the DevKit](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/1-ruby-and-devkit/) like this: 

    cd C:/RubyDevKit
    ruby dk.rb init
    ruby dk.rb install

### Clone octopress 

__clone the source branch to the local octopress folder__

> using HTTPS
>
> git clone -b source https://github.com/okckd/okckd.github.io.git octopress

> or using SSH
>
> git clone -b source git@github.com:okckd/okckd.github.io.git octopress

I would recommend using SSH over HTTPS, because __using HTTPS, you will need to type your username and password everytime you push__. 

To correct 'HTTPS' to 'SSH', follow [this instruction](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6565661): 

> git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

More info about HTTPS and SSH is [available](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/). 

### Install dependencies

Follow [this instruction](http://www.techelex.org/setup-octopress-windows7/) and install bundler and dependencies. 

    cd c:/github/octopress
    gem install bundler
    rbenv rehash    # optional, unless you are using rbenv
    bundle install

If you see endless dependency errors here, please refer to my other post: __[[Ruby] Endless error with gem dependencies](/blog/2014/12/23/Endless-error-gem-dependencies/)__. 

If you are confused with some concepts in Ruby, read __[[Ruby] RubyGems, gem, Gemfile and Bundler](/blog/2014/12/22/RubyGems-gem-other/)__. 

### Now, start octopress

You can use either of the commands below to start octopress. I can't remember clearly but you can simply follow [this guide](http://octopress.org/docs/setup/).

> rake setup_github_pages
>
> when prompted, enter this url: git@github.com:okckd/okckd.github.io.git
>
> rake install

### Commit your changes

You can do 'rake gen_deploy' to deploy to master branch. Do 'git commit", "git push origin source' to update blog source. [reference](http://blog.zerosharp.com/clone-your-octopress-to-blog-from-two-places/)

At this step, congratulations you are all set! 

### Last word

Setting 'rake' up is found to be a great hassle for many, for example, [someone spent 7 hours on it](http://hamaluik.com/posts/switching-to-octopress/). 

Wish this post can help!
