    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Question 

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5090693043191808)

> Calculate the number of slices. Slice means that the difference between the maximum and minimum in the slice <= 2.

> eg. Given array 3 5 7 6 3. 

> There're 10: (0,0) (1,1) (2,2) (3,3) (4,4) (5,5) (0,1) (1,2) (1,3) (2,3). 

### Solution 

If only asked to output the total number of such slices, we can do it in __O(n) using sliding-window-like algorithm__, with the help of addtional queue-like data structure. 

This is __a very difficult question__! Quoted from the [top answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5090693043191808):

> The basic idea is that you can start with arr[0] and then see __how many more elements you can include before you violate the max -min <= K constraint__. When you reach some index j you can no longer include, you know the maximum subarray starting at index 0 is arr[0...j-1], and you can count j different subarrays there. 

> ... you then start with a[1]. Now [1...j-1] has to be valid, so you try to advance the right boundary again (try arr[1...j], then arr[1...j+1]) and so on until again you reach a point past which you can't advance. Then you'll try string at a[2], and so on. This is what they mean when they talk about __"crawling" over the array__. 

> The key issue here is how you will check whether a particular subarray is valid efficiently...

Sliding window is explained above. Now, __the minMaxQueue__ explain in [this pdf](https://codility.com/media/train/solution-count-bounded-slices.pdf): 

> The PDF ... have __1 queue each__ (i.e. 2 queues in total) for min and max (the min is treated analogous to the max case). 

> For maxQueue, whenever a new value comes in the max queue, they remove all values less than the value, since those __can never be the max__. For that reason the queue's values are in descending order. And the max at any given time is the first element.

In this way, getting min/max is O(1), thus entire solution is O(n). Nice question!

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=4281027)

> Convert a BST to max heap. 

### Solution 

The [second answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=4281027): 

> a simple (reversed) in-order traversal of the BST. It would produce a sorted array which is indeed a max-heap!

### Question 2

[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14106821/converting-a-heap-to-a-bst-in-on-time)

> Converting a heap to a BST in O(n) time?

> possible? 

### Solution 

[Impossible](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14107362). Because otherwise, we can do this: 

1. Take an array and build the heap in O(n) time
1. Converting the heap to a BST in O(n) time (assuming) 
1. Walking the BST in O(n) time to get a sorted sequence.

Thus we sort array in O(n) time, it can't happen. 

Right way to do, is to repeatedly dequeueing maximum value from the BST, then generate the BST recursively (bottom-up approach).

[link](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=14912744)

> You are given an array of n elements [1,2,....n]. For example {3 2 1 4 6 5 7}. 

> Now we create a signature of this array by comparing every consecutive pair of elements. If they increase, write "I" else write "D". 

> For example for the above array, the signature would be "DDIIDI". The signature thus has a length of N-1. 

> Now given a signature, compute the lexicographically __smallest permutation__ of [1,2,....n]. 

### Solution 

A great [answer](http://qr.ae/BPfNw): 

> Take the above case. Signature = DDIIDI.

> Take original permutation as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

> Then for first continuous sequence DD reverse the strip 1 2 3 to 3 2 1 hence sequence becomes 3 2 1 4 5 6 7.

> Then for second sequence D reverse strip 5 6 to 6 5 hence sequence becomes 3 2 1 4 6 5 7.

> There is no continuous D left we are done and reached the answer.

[link](http://www.mitbbs.com/article_t/JobHunting/32043661.html)

> How to transform a unbalanced tree into balanced tree?

### Solution 

Solution 1, do AVL tree balancing. Refer to __[Design] BST Node Insertion / Deletion__. This is of course, pretty difficult to code. 

Best solution is to __convert to DLL and then build a new tree__!

> How to serialize strings and pass it over the network and de-serialize the string? 

> The string may contain __any possible character__ out of 256 valid characters. 

### Solution 

The difficulty is how to __differentiate between data (string) and metadata__. Some interesting ideas:

1. XML
2. message with header + body

The best is the [top answer](http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5979667): 

> I think that a good answer is to send the length of the string in bytes (coded for example as a 4 bytes unsigned integer) followed by the list of bytes, one per char. 

> The receiver reads the first 4 bytes and understand the string length (let says L), then it reads the following L bytes and build the string.

eg. 5hello 5world 2my 4name 2is
