    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Overview

[Model–view–controller]((http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) is a software architectural pattern for implementing __user interfaces__. 

### Components 

The central component of MVC, __the model__, captures the application's behavior in terms of its problem domain, independent of the user interface. The model directly manages the application's data, logic and rules. 

__A view__ can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a diagram; multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. 

The third part, __the controller__, accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.

Early web MVC frameworks took a thin client approach that placed almost the entire MVC on server. As client technologies have matured, MVC components can be executed partly on the client(AJAX). 

### Other good explanation

MVC is a [user interface design pattern](http://geekswithblogs.net/gregorymalcolm/archive/2009/07/14/user-interface-patterns.aspx). 

1. Controller – Represents interactions, typically with the mouse or keyboard, or in the case of web applications, in the form of HTTP requests.
 
1. View – Renders the graphical output of the application
 
1. Model – Everything else. In particular this includes __the data and business logic__.

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/03/Multilayered-architecture/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-03T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/03/Multilayered-architecture</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### First Word

A [multilayered software architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayered_architecture) is a software architecture that uses many layers for allocating the different responsibilities of a software product.

### Layers

1. __Presentation layer__
    a. UI layer, view layer
    a. presentation tier in multitier architecture
1. __Application layer__
    a. also called service layer/GRASP Controller Layer
1. __Business layer__
    a. also called business logic layer/domain layer
1. Infrastructure layer
    1. data access layer/__persistence layer__
    1. logging, networking, and other services which are required to support a particular business layer

### Conventions

__Application layer__ (or service layer) is sometimes considered a sublayer of __business layer__. 

If there's no explicit distinction between first 3 tiers, then it's a __traditional client-server(two-tier) model__.

The __application/business layers__ can, in fact, be further subdivided to emphasize distinct responsibility (eg. MVC). 

Sometimes there's __business infrastructure layer(BI)__, located between the business layer and infrastructure layer. 

Infrastructure layer can be partitioned into different levels (high-level or low-level). __Developers focus on only the persistence capabilities__, therefore only talk about persistence layer or data access layer.

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Shuffle-an-array/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Shuffle-an-array</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Question 

[link](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shuffle-a-given-array/)

> Given an array, generate a random permutation of array elements. 

### Analysis

This is called __[Fisher–Yates shuffle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)__. Proof can be seen at question post: 

> The probability that ith element goes to second last position can be proved to be 1/n by dividing it in two cases.

> Case 1: i = n-1 (index of last element):

> The probability of last element going to second last position is = (probability that last element doesn't stay at its original position) x (probability that the index picked in previous step is picked again so that the last element is swapped)

> So the probability = ((n-1)/n) x (1/(n-1)) = 1/n

> Case 2: 0 < i < n-1 (index of non-last):

> The probability of ith element going to second position = (probability that ith element is not picked in previous iteration) x (probability that ith element is picked in this iteration)

> So the probability = ((n-1)/n) x (1/(n-1)) = 1/n

> We can easily generalize above proof for any other position. 

### Solution

O(n) time complexity. 

	To shuffle an array a of n elements (indices 0..n-1):
	  for i from n − 1 downto 1 do
	       j ← random integer with 0 ≤ j ≤ i
	       exchange a[j] and a[i]

Note the RNG is having limit from 0 to i, and number i keeps decreasing. 

### Code

__not written by me__

	def sattoloCycle(items):
	    i = len(items)
	    while i > 1:
	        i = i - 1
	        j = randrange(i)  # 0 <= j <= i-1
	        items[j], items[i] = items[i], items[j]
	    return

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Overriding-private-method/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Overriding-private-method</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Question 

[link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2000137/overriding-private-methods-in-java)

> Can we overriding private method in Java? 

### Analysis

> Overriding private methods in Java is invalid because a parent class's private methods are "automatically final, and hidden from the derived class".  [source](http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/thinking_in_java/TIJ309_006.htm)

### Solution

You can't override a private method, but you can introduce one in a derived class [without a problem](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2000156). Read more below. 

### Code

__not a problem__

	public class OverridePrivateMethod {
		private void foo() {
		}
	}
	
	class Child extends OverridePrivateMethod {
		private void foo() {
		}
	}

__add @Override annotation and get error__

	public class OverridePrivateMethod {
		private void foo() {
		}
	}
	
	class Child extends OverridePrivateMethod {
		@Override
		private void foo() {
		}
	}

    <link href="http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Max-Sum-In-2D-Array/"/>
    <updated>2014-08-01T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/Max-Sum-In-2D-Array</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Question 

[link](http://tech-queries.blogspot.sg/2010/05/find-max-sum-in-2d-array.html)

> Given a 2D array, find the maximum sum subarray in it. For example, in the following 2D array, the maximum sum subarray is highlighted with blue rectangle and sum of this subarray is 29.

<img class="middle" src="/assets/images/max-sum-2d-matrix.png">

### Analysis

Try convert this question to "__max sum in 1D array__" by sum up all numbers in the same column. (we know that in 1D array, the algo runs O(n) time)

There's in total O(n^2) combinations of ways to sum up a column. So the __total time complexity is O(n^3)__. 

### Solution

1. Traverse matrix at row level.

1. have a temporary 1-D array and initialize all members as 0.

1. For each row do following

    1. add value in temporary array for all rows below current row
    1. apply 1-D kadane on temporary array
    1. if your current result is greater than current maximum sum, update.

### Code

__written by me__

	public int maxSum(int[][] A) {
		int m = A.length;
		int n = A[0].length;
		int maxResult = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			int[] temp = new int[n];
			for (int j = i; j < m; j++) {
				// from row#i to row#(m-1), add the number into temp[]
				for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
					temp[k] += A[j][k];
				}
				// find max sum for 1D array
				maxResult = Math.max(maxResult, maxSum(temp));
			}
		}
		return maxResult;
	}

	private int maxSum(int[] B) {
		int sumSoFar = 0;
		int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		for (int i = 0; i < B.length; i++) {
			maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sumSoFar + B[i]);
			sumSoFar = Math.max(0, sumSoFar + B[i]);
		}
		return maxSum;
	}
