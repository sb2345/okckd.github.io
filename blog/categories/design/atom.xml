#### 1. Too Many HTTP Requests

This is the single biggest contributor to performance problems in most web pages. 

1. Concatenate scripts and stylesheets

1. Combine images with sprites (put common images into a single large image file, then use CSS to position and selectively display the appropriate portion of the sprite image)

1. Use fewer images, more CSS. 

#### 2. Minimal Client-side Processing

1. Validation on client. (eg. form input)

1. Use web standards and MVC separation, making a maintainable, accessible, future-proof and max-performance website. 

    Think of the HTML as the model, the CSS as the view, and the JavaScript as the controller. This separation tends to make code more efficient and maintainable, and makes many optimization techniques much more practical to apply.

1. Push presentation code into the client tier (eg. Charts and graphs — push raw data to the client in JSON format, and use JavaScript and CSS to create pretty graphs.)

1. Leverage Ajax techniques (only requiring small parts of the page to change in response to user actions)

#### 3. Low Number of Parallel Requests

Fetch a script, parse and execute it, then fetch another one... this will use up all the available connections. There are things you can do to your HTML to allow virtually any browser to make many requests at once, which has a huge impact on latency.

1. Use browser-appropriate domain sharding

1. Use intelligent script loading

1. Leverage Keep-Alive (reuse the same TCP connection for multiple HTTP request/response cycles)

#### 4. Failure to leverage browser cache / local storage

1. [HTTP cache overview](http://www.mnot.net/cache_docs/)

1. Leverage local storage

#### 5. Third-party widgets

1. Avoid third-party widgets!
1. Try to use widgets that provide asynchronous implementations, so their inevitably terrible performance impacts their widget without dragging down your entire UX with it.

#### 7. Failure to Use a Global Network

Amazon S3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Website KPI

There are [3 interesting phases](https://community.compuwareapm.com/community/display/PUB/Best+Practices+on+Web+Site+Performance+Optimization) of a web site from an end-user performance perspective. 

1. First Impression
1. OnLoad 
1. Fully Loaded Time.

### Loading Time

__Question: what percentage of the time a user spends waiting for your page to load is spent after the HTML comes back to their browser__? 

It is typically __[over 90%](http://www.sitepoint.com/seven-mistakes-that-make-websites-slow/)__. 

Most of the time users spend waiting on your website is spent after the HTML page has been retrieved by their browser. 

#### Fetching the HTML is just the beginning

__In a nutshell, browsers parse your page’s HTML, sequentially discovering its assets__ (such as scripts, stylesheets, and images), requesting and then either parsing and executing them or displaying them as appropriate. 

But these assets are not simply fetched all at once. Instead, the __browser opens a limited number of connections to the server(s)__ referenced by the page. There is __overhead involved in establishing TCP and HTTP connections__, and some __unavoidable latency__ in pushing the request and response bytes back and forth across the network.

So, in general, round trips between the browser and server are expensive. The structure of the HTML markup, the number and the ordering of its assets, are absolutely critical factors in its performance.

#### 9. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)

Your site’s speed is greatly affected by where the user’s location is, relative to your web server. The farther away they are, the more distance the data being transmitted has to travel. Having your content cached __across multiple, strategically placed geographical locations__ helps take care of this problem. 

A CDN will often make your operating cost a little higher, but you definitely gain a speed bonus. Check out MaxCDN or __Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)__.

#### 10. Optimize Web Caching

Along with using caching systems, you should create websites that utilize __web caching__ as much as possible. Web caching is when files are __cached by the web browser__ for later use. Things that browsers can cache include CSS files, JavaScript files, and images.

Aside from the basics, such as putting CSS and JavaScript code that are used in multiple pages in external files, there are many ways to make sure that you are caching your files in the most efficient way possible.

For example, you can set HTTP response headers such as Expires and Last-Modified to reduce the need of re-downloading certain files when the user comes back to your site. To learn more, read about [caching in HTTP](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html) and [leveraging browser caching](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/LeverageBrowserCaching?csw=1#LeverageBrowserCaching).

To set up HTTP Expires headers in Apache, read this tutorial on adding future expires headers.

#### Other mentions

4. __Avoid Resizing Images in HTML__ (using HTML’s width and height attributes), for the sake of smaller file size. 

6. __Optimize Image Sizes by Using the Correct File Format__. Eg. JPG format often displays photographic images at smaller file sizes than PNG. 

7. __Optimize the Way You Write Code__. For example, instead of using (h1)(em)Your heading(em)(h1), you can easily use CSS to make your headings italics. 

    Writing code efficiently not only reduces file sizes of your HTML and CSS documents, but also makes it easier to maintain.

### Question

> Suppose you are handling Amazon website and you have 10 MB size home page. Optimize the homepage for a customer who has 100 kbps internet connection.

> Further he asked for the customer who has 100 mbps internet connection.

### Reading

[This](http://sixrevisions.com/web-development/site-speed-performance/) is a very nice article about website speedup. Below is the full quoted text. 

#### 1. Defer Loading Content When Possible

Ajax allows us to build web pages that can be __asynchronously updated__ at any time. This means that instead of reloading an entire page when a user performs an action, we can simply update parts of that page.

We can use an image gallery as an example. Image files are big and heavy; they can slow down page-loading speeds of web pages. Instead of loading all of the images when a user first visits the web page, we can just display thumbnails of the images and then when the user clicks on them, we can asynchronously request the full-size images from the server and update the page. This way, if a user only wants to see a few pictures, they don’t have to suffer waiting for all of the pictures to download. This development pattern is called __lazy loading__.

__Ajax/web development libraries__ like jQuery, Prototype, and MooTools can make deferred content-loading easier to implement.

#### 2. Use External JS and CSS Files

When the user first loads your web page, the browser will cache external resources like CSS and JavaScript files. Thus, instead of inline JavaScript and CSS files, it’s best to __place them in external files__.

Using inline CSS also increases the rendering time of a web page; having everything defined in your main CSS file lets the browser do less work when rendering the page, since it already knows all the style rules that it needs to apply.

__As a bonus__, using external JavaScript and CSS files makes site maintenance easier because you only need to maintain global files instead of code scattered in multiple web pages.

#### 3. Use Caching Systems

If you find that your site is connecting to your database in order to create the same content, it’s time to start using a __caching system__. By having a caching system in place, your site will only have to create the content once instead of creating the content every time the page is visited by your users. Don’t worry, caching systems periodically refresh their caches depending on how you set it up — so even constantly-changing web pages (like a blog post with comments) can be cached.

__Popular content management systems__ like WordPress and Drupal will have __static caching features__ that convert dynamically generated pages to static HTML files to reduce unnecessary server processing. For WordPress, check out [WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) (one of the six critical WordPress plugins which, claimed by the author, enjoyed a improvement by 259.1% for content-heavy pages). Drupal has a page-caching feature in the core.

There are also __database caching and server-side scripts caching systems__ that you can install on your web server (if you have the ability to do so). For example, PHP has extensions called PHP accelerators that optimize performance through caching and various other methods; one example of a [PHP accelerator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP_accelerator) is APC. [Database caching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_caching) improves performance and scalability of your web applications by reducing the work associated with database read/write/access processes; __[memcached](http://www.memcached.org/)__, for example, caches frequently used database queries. 

#### 8. Load JavaScript at the End of Your Document

It’s best if you have your scripts loading at the end of the page rather than at the beginning. It allows for the browser to render everything before getting started with the JavaScript. This makes your web pages feel more responsive because the way JavaScript works is that it blocks anything below it from rendering until it has finished downloading. If possible, reference JavaScript right before the closing (body) tag of your HTML documents. To learn more, read about deferring the loading of JavaScript.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[## Overview

A Web server __exclusively handles HTTP requests__, whereas an application server __serves business logic__ to application programs through any number of protocols (including HTTP). 

#### Example: Apache Tomcat

web server + servlet container

#### Example: Glassfish

__application server__ (that supports EJB, JSF, JSP and servlets)

### Apache Tomcat

Apache Tomcat is [a web server and](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2469984) a Web container/Servlet container/JSP container (having all these names). It is used for strictly web-based applications but does not include the entire suite of capabilities of Java EE, thus not application server. 

Note: __Tomcat is [web container](http://okckd.github.io/blog/2014/08/05/Web-server-application-server/)__ where as Apache is web server.

### Servlet

[A servlet](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/servletapi/javax/servlet/Servlet.html) is __a small Java program that runs within a Web server__. Servlets receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP. 

### Glassfish 

Tomcat is not Java EE container, but only a servlet container. [If you plan to](http://stackoverflow.com/a/23563455) use full Java EE (which includes security and many other things), you have to switch from Tomcat to some of __full Java EE application servers__. Glassfish is one of them, others are TomEE, WildFly, IBM Websphere, Oracle Weblogic etc. 

### Web application

[A Web application](http://www.service-architecture.com/articles/application-servers/j2ee_web_server_or_container.html) runs within a __Web container__ of a __Web server__. The Web container provides the runtime environment through components that provide naming context and life cycle management. A Web server __may__ work with an EJB server to provide some of those services.

Web applications are composed of web components and other data such as HTML pages. Web components can be __servlets, JSP pages__ created with the JavaServer Pages™ technology, web filters, and web event listeners. These components execute in a web server and may respond to HTTP requests from web clients. 

### Application server VS. Web server, in short

__Web server__ just serves the web pages and it cannot enforce any application logic.

__Application server__ maintains the application logic and serves the web pages in response to user request.

That means application server can do both application logic maintanence and web page serving.

__Final conclusion__: Application server also contains the web server.

> Application server = Web Server + EJB container. 

### Web server Detail

A [Web server](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077354/learn-java/app-server-web-server-what-s-the-difference.html) __handles the HTTP protocol__. When the Web server receives an HTTP request, it responds with an HTTP response, such as sending back an HTML page. 

To process a request, a Web server may __respond with a static HTML page__, or delegate the __dynamic response__ such as CGI scripts, JSPs (JavaServer Pages), servlets, ASPs (Active Server Pages), server-side JavaScripts, or some other server-side technology. 

Web server is used only for Jsp and Servlets and static functionality. It doesn’t support EJB and JMS and JAAS.

### Application server Detail

An [Application server](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077354/learn-java/app-server-web-server-what-s-the-difference.html) __exposes business logic to client applications__ through various protocols, possibly including HTTP. The clients can include GUIs (graphical user interface) running on a PC, a Web server, or even other application servers. 

In most cases, the server exposes this business logic through a component API, such as the EJB (Enterprise JavaBean) component model found on J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) application servers.

### Example

There's [a nice example](http://www.javaworld.com/article/2077354/learn-java/app-server-web-server-what-s-the-difference.html): online store that provides real-time pricing. 

#### Scenario 1: Web server

The Web server takes your request, then passes it to a server-side program able to handle the request. The server-side program looks up the pricing information from a database or a flat file. Once retrieved, the server-side program uses the information to formulate the HTML response, then the Web server sends it back to your Web browser.

To summarize, a Web server simply processes HTTP requests __by responding with HTML pages__.

#### Scenario 2: Web server with an application server

Scenario 2 resembles Scenario 1 in that the Web server still delegates the response generation to a script. However, you can now put the business logic for the pricing lookup onto an application server. 

With that change, instead of the script knowing how to look up the data and formulate a response, the script can simply call the application server's lookup service. The script can then use the service's result when the script generates its HTML response.

In this scenario, the application server serves the business logic for looking up a product's pricing information. That functionality doesn't say anything about display or how the client must use the information. Instead, the client and application server send data back and forth. When a client calls the application server's lookup service, the service simply looks up the information and returns it to the client.

By separating the pricing logic from the HTML response-generating code, the pricing logic becomes far more reusable between applications. A second client, such as a cash register, could also call the same service as a clerk checks out a customer. In contrast, in Scenario 1 the pricing lookup service is not reusable because the information is embedded within the HTML page. To summarize, in Scenario 2's model, the Web server handles HTTP requests by replying with an HTML page while the application server serves application logic by processing pricing and availability requests.
