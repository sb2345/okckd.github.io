    <content type="html"><![CDATA[# Overview

Launched on Sep 15th, 1997

__60 trillion individual pages. 100 million GB data__. 

__40,000 search per second__, or 3 billion search per day. 

As of Feb 2015, 65% market share in US.

# 1. Crawl

Google crawl from 1 page to another using __[Googlebot](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/182072?vid=1-635765406868848825-432642872)__. It starts from previous urls crawled, or augmented with __[Sitemap data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_map)__

> __A sitemap__ is a list of pages of a web site accessible to crawlers or users. It can be either a document in any form used as a planning tool for Web design, or a Web page that lists the pages on a Web site, typically organized in hierarchical fashion.

# 2. Indexing 

Compile the data (key content tags, atrributes, like title tags, ALT attributes). Google don't process rich media or dynamic files. 

# 3. Algorithm

When search, pull all relevant results from the Index. 

Rank the result based on 200+ factors, one of which is the __[PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)__ for a given page.

> __PageRank__ is the measure of the importance of a page based on the incoming links from other pages. In simple terms, each link to a page on your site from another site adds to your site's PageRank. 

> Not all links are equal: Google works hard to identify spam links. The best types of links are those that are given based on the quality of your content.

To rank higher, follow [Webmaster Guidelines](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/35769?vid=1-635765406868848825-432642872).

    <link href="http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/07/23/how-is-pipe-implemented-unix/"/>
    <updated>2015-07-23T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/07/23/how-is-pipe-implemented-unix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[# Overview

In Unix-like OS, __[a pipeline is a set of processes](https://goo.gl/0NAqd9) chained by their standard streams__, so that the output of each process (stdout) feeds directly as input (stdin) to the next one. 

[Pipes are unidirectional byte streams which connect the standard output](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17503877) from one process into the standard input of another process. __Neither process is aware of this redirection__ and behaves just as it would normally. It is the shell which sets up these temporary pipes between the processes.

# Process

1. Linux has a VFS called __pipefs__ that is mounted in the kernel (not in user space)

    > __[PipeFS](http://www.linux.org/threads/pipefs-sockfs-debugfs-and-securityfs.5383/)__ is a unique virtual filesystem. __This filesystem is mounted inside the kernel__ rather than in the userspace. While most filesystems are mounted under "/", PipeFS is mounted on "pipe:", __making PipeFS its own root__ (yes, a second root filesystem). 
    >
    > This filesystem is one superblock and cannot exceed that amount system-wide. The entry point of this filesystem/second-root is the system-call "pipe()". Unlike the other virtual/pseudo filesystems, this one cannot be viewed.
    >
    > Many of you may be wondering what purpose this PipeFS filesystem serves. Unix pipes use this filesystem. When a pipe is used (eg. ls | less), __the pipe() system-call makes a new pipe object on this filesystem__. Without this filesystem, pipes cannot be made. 
    >
    > Also, threads and forks communicate together via pipes. Without PipeFS, processes could not fork and threads could not communicate. 
    >
    > Network pipes also rely on this virtual/pseudo filesystem.

1. pipefs has a single super block and is mounted at it's own root (pipe:), alongside /

1. pipefs cannot be viewed directly unlike most file systems

1. The entry to pipefs is via the pipe(2) syscall

1. The pipe(2) syscall used by shells for piping with the | operator (or manually from any other process) creates a new file in pipefs which behaves pretty much like a normal file

1. The file on the left hand side of the pipe operator has its stdout redirected to the temporary file created in pipefs

1. The file on the right hand side of the pipe operator has its stdin set to the file on pipefs

1. pipefs is stored in memory and through some kernel magic

    <link href="http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/06/09/Cryptographic-standards-AES-RSA/"/>
    <updated>2015-06-09T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/06/09/Cryptographic-standards-AES-RSA</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[# Overview

## 3 areas of cryptographic standard:

1. encryption standard

    1. Data Encryption Standard (obsolete)
    1. Triple DES
    1. __Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)__
    1. __RSA__
    1. OpenPGP
    1. CipherSaber

1. hash standard

    1. __MD5__
    1. __SHA-1__
    1. SHA-2
    1. HMAC
    1. PBKDF2

1. digital signature standard

    1. Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
    1. RSA
    1. Elliptic

## Symmetric-key algorithm 

[Use the same cryptographic keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) for both encryption and decryption. 

The keys represent a shared secret between two parties, and maintain a private information link. 

This requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks. 

## Public-key cryptography 

The public key is used: 

1. encrypt plaintext 
1. verify a digital signature

private key is used: 

1. decrypt ciphertext 
1. create a digital signature.

# Encryption standard

## RSA Vs. AES

__RSA is very computationally expensive__ by comparison with AES. It involves mathematics with very large numbers, whilst AES can be implemented with relatively simple bit operations. 

[RSA is a public-key encryption algorithm](http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/10949/encryption-should-i-be-using-rsa-or-aes) (asymmetric), while AES is a symmetric key algorithm. Often a cryptosystem will use both algorithms. 

[A good compromise is to](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13238674/aes-vs-rsa-to-encrypt-large-size-of-data) use RSA to encrypt the symmetric key that is then used in AES encryption of the larger data.

## GitHub

uses RSA encryption.

# hash standard

## MD5

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function producing a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value, or 32 digit Hex.

>
> good morning -> 2b849500e4585dab4196ec9a415edf8f

## SHA-1

SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, or 40 digit Hex.

## For more

About MD5, SHA-1 and other, refer to __[Design] Cryptographic Hash, MD5 and Digital Signature__

# digital signature standard

A valid digital signature gives a recipient confidence that the message was created by a known sender.

commonly used for software distribution, financial transactions 

<img class="middle" src="/assets/images/digital_signature.png">

[To create a digital signature](http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/digital-signature), signing software (such as an email program) creates a one-way hash of the data to be signed. The private key is then used to encrypt the hash. 

> The reason for encrypting the hash instead of entire message is that a hash function can convert an arbitrary input into a fixed length value, which is usually much shorter. 

Other party validate the integrity of the data by using the signer's public key to decrypt the hash.

> Note: you can choose to '__ Add digital signature to this message __' in Microsoft Office.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[# Overview 

[a port](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29) is __a software construct serving as a communications endpoint__ in a computer's host operating system.

purpose of ports is to uniquely identify different applications or processes running on a single computer and thereby __enable them to share a single physical connection to a packet-switched network__ like the Internet.

The protocols that __primarily use ports__ are the Transport Layer protocols, such as TCP and UDP. 

__Port info can be viewed on Linux /etc/services files__.

## there're only 65536 ports

In TCP/IP stack, port number field is just 16bit size unsigned integer. Port number thus ranging from 0 to 65535.

## well-known ports 

__Well-known ports__ (or Privileged Ports) are those from 0 through 1023.

> [When the IP packet contain TCP data](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/thread/61029) the protocol number field will have the value 6 in it, so the payload will be sent to the TCP stack, TCP would then use the port numbers to send the data to the correct application. The same is for UDP with protocol number 17.
 
> Another way to look at the IP protocol number field is, if we didn't have this field in the IP packet header, IP would only be capable of carrying one type of data, while adding this field allowed the IP to carry multiple types of data differentiated by the protocol number, the same goes for TCP/UDP using TCP/UDP ports to serve multiple applications and Ethernet using the Ethertype, and so on.

## can multiple app bind to (or listen to) the same port?

Can't. [Because You can only have one application](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1694144/can-two-applications-listen-to-the-same-port) listening on a single port at one time. 

> the app opens a port, gets a handle to it, and the OS notifies it (via that handle) when a client connection (or a packet in UDP case) arrives.
>
> If the OS allowed two apps to open the same port, how would it know which one to notify?

    <link href="http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/02/15/HBase-and-HDFS/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-15T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.shuatiblog.com/blog/2015/02/15/HBase-and-HDFS</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[### Overview 

[Hadoop Distributed File System](http://hortonworks.com/hadoop/hdfs/) (HDFS) is a __Java-based file system__ that provides scalable and reliable data storage that is designed to span large clusters of commodity servers. __HDFS, MapReduce__, and YARN form the core of Apache™ Hadoop®.

[Apache HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) is the Hadoop database, a distributed, scalable, big data store.

#### Hadoop

Hadoop is [basically 2 things](http://stackoverflow.com/a/16930049), a FS (Hadoop Distributed File System) and a computation framework (MapReduce). 

HDFS allows you store huge amounts of data in a distributed (provides faster read/write access) and redundant (provides better availability) manner. And MapReduce allows you to process this huge data in a distributed and parallel manner. 

But MapReduce is not limited to just HDFS. 

#### HDFS and HBase

Being a FS, HDFS lacks the random read/write capability. It is good for sequential data access. And this is where HBase comes into picture. It is a NoSQL database that runs on top your Hadoop cluster and provides you random real-time read/write access to your data.

### Now, the Comparison

__HDFS is a distributed file system__. [ref](http://qr.ae/BqrVU)

1. It is optimized for streaming access of large files. You would typically store files that are in the 100s of MB upwards on HDFS and access them through MapReduce to process them in batch mode. 
2. HDFS files are write once files. You can append to files in some of the recent versions but that is not a feature that is very commonly used. Consider HDFS files as write-once and read-many files. There is no concept of random writes.
3. HDFS doesn't do random reads very well.

__HBase is a database that stores it's data in a distributed filesystem__. 

The filesystem of choice typically is HDFS owing to the tight integration between HBase and HDFS. It doesn't mean that HBase can't work on any other filesystem.

1. Low latency access to small amounts of data from within a large data set. You can access single rows quickly from a billion row table.
2. Flexible data model to work with and data is indexed by the row key.
3. Fast scans across tables.
4. Scale in terms of writes as well as total volume of data.
